# leapMotion_oculus_tutorial
Walkthrough for setting up &amp; creating a basic basketball game with oculus &amp; leap motion in Unity 3D.

<b>Before starting you will need the following:</b>
<br>Oculus Rift Development Starter Kit
<br>Leap Motion Kit
<br>PC with multiple USB & HDMI attachments
<br>Power source<br>

<b>Step 1 - Setting up the Oculus & Leap Motion</b>
<br>Ensure the leap motion device is connected to the computer via USB and then mounted on the front of the Oculus Rift. (Note: If you are using the first developer version of the Oculus then there will not be a mount available for the leap motion. Our group used double sided velcro tape and it seemed to work great.)<br><br>

<b>Step 2 - Ensure Oculus is powered</b>
<br>Ensure the Oculus Rift is powered and connected to the computer via HDMI & USB. A blue eye icon lights up blue to siginal the oculus is powered on.<br>

<b>Step 3 - Install Unity 3D</b>
<br>Once all drivers have been installed on the computer then start up the Unity 3D program. * From here you can run the Basketball Unity project in the assets folder if you want to see our final project.<br>
