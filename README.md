# leapMotion_oculus_tutorial
Walkthrough for setting up &amp; creating a basic basketball game with oculus &amp; leap motion in Unity 3D. <br>Also check our <b>report</b> for detailed instructions & pictures. 

<b>Before starting you will need the following:</b>
<br>Oculus Rift Development Starter Kit
<br>Leap Motion Kit
<br>PC with multiple USB & HDMI attachments
<br>Power source<br>

# The Setup
<b>Step 1 - Setting up the Oculus & Leap Motion</b>
<br>Ensure the leap motion device is connected to the computer via USB and then mounted on the front of the Oculus Rift. (Note: If you are using the first developer version of the Oculus then there will not be a mount available for the leap motion. Our group used double sided velcro tape and it seemed to work great.)<br>

<b>Step 2 - Ensure Oculus is powered</b>
<br>Ensure the Oculus Rift is powered and connected to the computer via HDMI & USB. A blue eye icon lights up blue to siginal the oculus is powered on.<br>

<b>Step 3 - Install Unity 3D & Create</b>
<br>Once all drivers have been installed on the computer then start up the Unity 3D program and begin creating. <br>If you have not yet installed UNITY 3D, you can download it from their website <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download" target="_blank">here</a>. <br>* From here you check out our final result by downloading our unity file from github and importing it into your Unity assets folders. You can then run the Basketball Unity project from selecting it from your assets folder<br>

# Where can I import 3D assets from?
A great website for downloading <b>FREE</b> 3D assets is <a href="http://tf3dm.com/" target="_blank">TF3DM</a>. You can then import these files directly into your Unity project.
