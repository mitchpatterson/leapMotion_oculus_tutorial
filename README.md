# leapMotion_oculus_tutorial
Walkthrough for setting up &amp; creating a basic basketball game with oculus &amp; leap motion in Unity 3D.

<b>Step 1 - Setting up the Oculus & Leap Motion</b>
Ensure the leap motion device is connected to the computer via USB and then mounted on the front of the Oculus Rift. (Note: If you are using the first developer version of the Oculus then there will not be a mount available for the leap motion. Our group used double sided velcro tape and it seemed to work great.)
